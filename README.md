# Web Page Design with Div and Buttons
Using a CSS grid to place the buttons when screen size is > 699px, and position:absolute when < 699px.

Buttons line up in center but are left aligned in their column. When adding text above them, it aligns left also. I'd like the text to center align above the button.
